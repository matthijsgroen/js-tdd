# Building a calculator, episode 2

After finishing [episode 1][episode1] you should have a small codebase
and test suite, with the following functions:

* add
* subtract
* times
* square

## Refactoring to lambdas
The following test should end up as *green*:

```js
describe("Episode 1 verification", () =>
  it("can add, subtract, times, and square numbers", () =>
    expect(times(subtract(square(add(2, 3)), 5), 5)).to.eql(100)
  )
);
```

now we know the code works, we could refactor the `functions` into a
version with [lamda][lamda]'s, this is the "Modern" way to define
functions. They have a slightly different way how their scope works, but
we get to that later ðŸ˜…

In short, refactor this:

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

into this:

```js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

as you can see, the `return` statement is gone. This is because we don't
use the `{}` for the body, and thus is it a single statement, that is an
implicit return of its result.

## Exercise
Refactor the other methods into single statement lambdas.

## Square method
So, how did the `square` method ended up?

There are a lot of possible ways for it:

```js
const square = a => Math.pow(a, 2)
const square = a => times(a, a);
const square = a => a * a;
```

Now we can do "calculations". But its not a calculator *yet*.

The calculator we want should have a result, that is `0` by default.
each instruction should work upon that result.

Here are the first 'specs' for this calculator.

Add the following code to the `test/calculator.spec.js` file

```js
import { expect } from "chai";

describe("Calculator", () => {

  // only run this test for now
  it.only("has a default result of 0", () =>
    expect(calculator.result).to.eql(0);
  );

  it("can add numbers", () => {
    expect(calculator.result).to.eql(0);
    calculator.add(10)
    expect(calculator.result).to.eql(10);
  });

  it("can chain commands", () => {
    expect(calculator.result).to.eql(0);
    calculator.times(2).add(10).times(2)
    expect(calculator.result).to.eql(20);
  });
});
```

Note that the first test starts with `it.only` and the other tests only have `it`. The reason for
this is because we only want to run the first test and not the others. The test runner now ignores
all the other tests. But don't forget to remove it later!

This block of tests has no 'setup' structure. Normally a test has 3 A's.

- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

You can add a single setup block that is repeated for each test by creating a 'before' step.

In `test/calculator.spec.js`

```js
describe("Calculator", () => {
  let calculator;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // ... setup the proper 'calculator' to make the tests pass.
  });
});
```

Focus only on making the first test pass.

There are actually a lot of ways to implement just enough to make the first test pass.
There are at least 4 different ways to create this 'object' needed to make this pass.
Just go with the most simplest form you can think of for now.

* Can you make all the tests pass?
