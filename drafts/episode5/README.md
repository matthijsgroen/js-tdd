# Building a calculator, episode 3

After finishing [episode 2][episode2] you should have a small codebase
and test suite, with some functions and an calculator 'object'
experiment.

To provide some more insight into 'objects', this time we are going to
do a little experimentation.

Move the provided `calculator.spec.js` into your experiment codebase.
(that you have set up during [episode 1][episode1])

The file consists of 3 parts.

1. 5 different ways of creating an calculator object
2. Picking our 'makeCalculator' factory
3. Testing our calculator

Goal:

1. Try out each form of implementing the calculator
2. Make sure you understand each form of implementing it
3. Figure out why certain tests fail in certain cases
